        I build custom interiors and kitchens, built-in cabinets and free-standing
        furniture. I use solid wood, veneers, metal, stone and plastics: each
        material has a beauty and a place, each material requires an understanding of
        its strengths and weaknesses, both visual and mechanical.

        My career began in 1988 in San Francisco, building houses for a custom
        builder. As my ability to construct things grew I began sketching
        designs for furniture and lighting and in 1991 I began working for
        myself, building custom furniture in the backyard of my Haight street
        apartment, selling to shops and individuals.

        In 1994, after tiring of the trials of an outdoor workshop, which are
        many, I joined the San Francisco Carpenters union local 22, and
        finished my apprenticeship building the interior of the Eddie Bauer
        store in downtown SF. I then worked several years for a company called
        Design Workshops, installing ultra-high-end interiors in investment and
        law firms in Silicon Valley.  While visiting friends in Amsterdam
        in 2004 I found an opportunity to open a workshop and took it.

        Each project is different because each client is different. The ability
        to quickly adapt and understand different needs and constraints is
        important.  A project may require following a drawing to exact detail
        or it may require that I invent a piece or an interior from scratch.
